# pytoast

An easy to use Python API for Windows 10's Toast functionality. It can currently only show a default icon, title and basic content. It could be considered abandoned at this point, but still does function.

Example:
```python
from pytoast import show_toast

show_toast('Super cool title', 'Even better content')
```
